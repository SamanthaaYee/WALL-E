# WALL-E
An intricate and detailed 3D model of the robot Wall-E from the self-titled Pixar film one of my favourite films. This build was created with SolidWorks and involved building each individual piece before combining them into a comprehensive assembly. I also incorporated seats to his head and body design, envisioning him as a transportation vehicle suitable for potential use in Walt Disney parks. 

The end result is a finely crafted model of Wall-E (plus a little plant! ðŸª´) with an exploded diagram and section view, showcasing attention to detail and skill in precise and complex 3D modeling.
